Hi! I'm Riley and I have been designing and developing Class III medical devices for over 13 years. My comfort zone is stents and stent grafts but my current project is an ablation catheter for treating chronic hypertension.  Recently I've become interested in coding and predictive modeling and have been teaching myself the basics of the R programming language.  My hope is to use this site to share tools, concepts, and stray thoughts related to device development. Thanks for taking a look!
